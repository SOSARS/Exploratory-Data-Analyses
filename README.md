# Exploratory Data Analyses

**Automobile Capstone Project**

The project serves as an exploratory data analysis task used to analyse a set of automobiles. The dataset provides information on the various components and specifications of the vehicles such as the body-style, manufacturer, wheelbase length, storage capacity, etc. The project was undertaken to identify the trends of the various vehicle manufacturers such as whether certain manufacturers opt for a specific wheelbase, aspirator and/or fuel system. Included in the analysis is the analysis on the vehicle style that is favoured by manufacturers. In other words, to identify whether manufacturers opt to produce sedans over SUVs because sedans are smaller and generally cheaper than SUVs to produce.

*How the data is analysed*

The data is analysed by making use of Python and data visualisation libraries such as Matplotlib, and Pandas. Python and Pandas are primarily used to analyse the dataset. This analysis includes identifying null values in the dataset, assessing the effect that the null values have on the data inferences that can be. If the impact of the null values is great on the statistical results that are obtained, removing the null values is the next adopted step. This is likely to be followed by changing and updating specific records that do not comply with the rest of the structure, removing rows and columns that provide little to no value in the analysis, and making use of visualisation (statistical charts) to provide a visual representation of the grouped data that meets a specific criterion.

*Main findings*

After analysis, it is made clear that vehicle manufacturers favour the production and distribution of gas vehicles as opposed to diesel vehicles. Why that is has been left unanswered due to lack of additional context, but the assumption remains that manufacturers opt for gas vehicles because they are more cost-effective to produce than diesel vehicles. Manufacturers lean more towards STD aspirators due to the improved fuel-efficieny provided by the aspirators. More information on these findings is provided in EDA.docx.





**Capstone III**

The project entails the dataset pertaining to video game sales recorded in North America, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world. The video game sales are split into genres such as action, role-playing, shooter and adventure along with the various platforms and publishers of the video games. The dataset found on Kaggle is used to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis, otherwise referred to as an EDA, to identify trends and correlations in video game sales across the years, and in varying parts of the world. This process included the identification of null values, columns that were deemed irrelevant to the analysis, and columns that had to be removed to make for easier analysis. This process provided a better platform to create visualisations that present the information in a readable manner. Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, and Missingno are modules that have been used to aid the analysis of the dataset.

*How the data is analysed*

By making use of the modules listed above, the modules allowed for easier filtering and analysis. Analysis refers to grouping the data based on specific criteria to identify trends, make inferences based on the results, and establish visualisations of the outcomes. The main focus is placed on the best performing video game platforms, most favoured genres based on the country, and sales performance of the various video game publishers. 

*Main findings*

Japan is recognised for the most video game sales in the "Role-playing" genre whereas the rest of the world appears to lean more towards the action genre. Based on the popularity of anime, a Japanese film and television etymology, which in itself consists of role-playing aspects, may be the contributing factor to the high volume of video game sales in the role-playing genre. 

Nintendo is indentified as the most successful publisher, based on the high volume of sales, across the globe. Dominating every video game market in the world due to the increased interactivity that is offered by the publisher on the gaming platforms known as the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii.
