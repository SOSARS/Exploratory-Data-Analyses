# Level-2-Capstones

*Automobile Capstone Project*

The project serves as an exploratory data analysis task used to analyse a set of automobiles. The dataset provides information on the various components and specifications of the vehicles such as the body-style, manufacturer, wheelbase length, storage capacity, etc. The project was undertaken to identify the trends of the various vehicle manufacturers such as whether certain manufacturers opt for a specific wheelbase, aspirator and/or fuel system. Included in the analysis is the analysis on the vehicle style that is favoured by manufacturers. In other words, to identify whether manufacturers opt to produce sedans over SUVs because sedans are smaller and generally cheaper than SUVs to produce.

*How the data is analysed*

The data is analysed by making use of modules such as python, matplotlib and pandas. Python and pandas are primarily used to analyse the dataset. This analysis includes identifying null values and removing the null values, changing and updating specific records that did not comply with the rest of the structure, removing rows and columns that provided little to no value in the analysis and making use of visualisations to provide a visual representation of grouped data that meets a specific criteria.

*Main findings*

After analysis, it is made clear that vehicle manufacturers favour the production and distribution of gas vehicles as opposed to diesel vehicles. Why that is has been left unanswered due to lack of additional context, but the assumption remains that manufacturers opt for gas vehicles because they are more cost-effective to produce than diesel vehicles. Manufacturers lean more towards STD aspirators due to the improved fuel-efficieny provided by the aspirators. More on these findings in EDA.docx.
